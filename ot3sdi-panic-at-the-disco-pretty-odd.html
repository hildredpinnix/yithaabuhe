Product description. PANIC AT THE DISCO PRETTY ODD Amazon.com. The title gives it away instantly- Pretty.Odd. (don't forget the periods) is not exactly the album that affirmed admirers of Panic At The Disco will have expected. Panic! at the Disco (parfois raccourci à P!ATD) est un groupe de pop / rock alternatif américain, originaire de Las Vegas, dans le Nevada.Ils changent de nom au début de l'année 2008 pour devenir Panic at the Disco, mais décident finalement de remettre le point d'exclamation après le départ de Ryan Ross et Jon Walker. In the two and a half years since its multi-platinum debut, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, threatened to eclipse the band—Fall Out Boy—whose bassist helped bring it to national attention, Panic At The Disco has done a lot more than strip the exclamation point from its name.

Panic's second record, Pretty. Odd, departed sharply from their ultra industrial debut album and veered sweetly more toward a sound and aesthetic that they would come to lose on their third release. Pretty. Odd. is one of my all-time favorite albums, but as far as Panic At The Disco goes, it is a pretty unique album (i.e. their other albums do not sound like this one). Anything similar would be greatly appreciated. 'Pretty. Odd.', released 10 years ago this week, may have flopped commercially, but that's not to say the effort was in vain. It established Panic as a band willing to take great creative risks and allowed its members to get the classic rock bug out of their systems. Panic! At The Disco's Pretty. Odd. is a polarizing album that's viewed as everything from a hailed fan favorite to a knock-off of The Beatles. 
If you have any of these albums in good shape for a good price An underrated, '60s-indebted gem that divided fans and caused Panic At The Disco to split in two, 'Pretty. Odd.' has aged incredibly well over the last decade. So let me preface this by saying that I am not a fan of pop punk, or whatever genre first comes to mind when thinking of P!ATD. That being said, I'm not stubbornly dismissive of it as a musical genre, I just tend to not enjoy a lot of the music. In 2008 I had a coworker who was a huge fan of bands like Fall Out Boy, Motion City Soundtrack, and Panic at the Disco. I condescendedly ignored him when talking about music (I was a 19-year-old music snob). But one day we were working

Panic at the Disco's (or Panic! at the Disco, if you may) second album, "Pretty Odd" polarized music critics when it first came out. Wikipedia even mentioned that the album's release created "fan confusion" as Panic's first album was more pop-punk while their second album was more of a throwback to 60s baroque pop. Personally, I thought Panic at that time was going in the right direction, opting to expand and experiment their baroque pop sound.

Sure, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was great for what it was but I feel, had Panic continued down the stylistic path of Pretty.
